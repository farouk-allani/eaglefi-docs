EagleFi’s Portfolio page shows all your assets on the Massa blockchain.

### How to View Your Portfolio
1. Connect your wallet (see [Getting Started](#getting-started)).
2. Click **Portfolio** in the EagleFi sidebar.
3. See your balances for MASSA and other tokens.
4. View your liquidity pool positions (if any).

### Features
- **Token Balances**: Real-time value of your holdings.
- **Transaction History**: Recent swaps or transfers. <!-- Q4: Does Portfolio show history? -->
- **Export**: Download your portfolio as a CSV (optional). <!-- Q5: Is this feature available? -->

### Tips
- Ensure your wallet is connected to Massa’s [mainnet/testnet].
- Refresh the page if balances don’t update.

**Troubleshooting**: Don’t see your tokens? Check your wallet address or network settings.
